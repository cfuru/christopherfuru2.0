      <description>IntroductionMethodImporting tickers from excel-fileScraping functionsResultIntroductionIn this report I will load stock tickers from an excel file in order to use the tickers when downloading historical price data for each stock. So firstly I will use the xlrd-library in order to open and retrieve excel-data. Secondly I will use Maik Rosenheinrich beautiful functions that enables talking to Yahoo-finance in order to retrieve price-data (see his blogpost at blogpost).</description>

      <description>IntroductionMethodStoring fundamentals dataStoring stock pricesResultHistorical stock pricesFundamental stock dataIntroductionIn this post I will give an example of one way to store data into a Microsoft SQL server located on the Azure cloud. I will do this both for the fundamentals data from an earlier post but also for the price data, also from an earlier post. The storing procedure will look identical for both cases.</description>

      <description>Importing tickers from an excelfileLets start by importing tickers/symbols from a regular xlsx excel file, where I have stored the symbols/tickers in a column named “Ticker”. The talked-about excelsheet looks like this
Figure 1. Example of a yahoo-finance statistics table where T is used for trillion instead of the prefix \(10^(12)\)
Now lets write some simple python code to assimilate the necessary information in the excel sheet. The methodology will be to loop through the column “Ticker” and store each ticker in a pandas dataframe.</description>
